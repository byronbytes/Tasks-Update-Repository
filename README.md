# Tasks-Update-Repository
The official repository for every version of Tasks including the legacy versions. This repository will get updated on every new Tasks release.

## What is this for?
An upcoming project that helps people organize and modify software that I have developed. (Such as Tasks, NoLexa when that releases, etc)

## TODO
- Organize directories either in a Non-Legacy and Legacy format
- Support for different archives in this repository?
